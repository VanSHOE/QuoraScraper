consumption in hyperlipidemic adults - Effects on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk
2010 paper by David L. Katz's group from Yale University where they examined the effects of either 2 eggs daily, sausages and cheese or an egg substitute (comprised of 99% egg whites and provide 12 key vitamins and nutrients, including riboflavin, B12, folate, and pantothenic acid, while excluding the cholesterol contribution of the egg yolk) on serum lipids (no effects, and a lowering on the egg substitute without the egg yolk) and vascular endothelial reactivity as a measure of endothelial function, very important prognostic factor for developing (athero-sclerotic) vascular disease (no effects, egg substitute was beneficial).",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-2764397-50-7a9aAeWSuQxDCjR9WwfT9TOW2XVWHqWR.jpeg']
