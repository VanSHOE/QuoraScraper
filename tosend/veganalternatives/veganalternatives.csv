"As a vegan, how do you deal with people who say that they ""love"" meat?","Taste cannot be any justification. Remember, no person has ever gone vegan because they dislike the taste of animal products. If your action involves a “victim”, it is no longer considered a “personal” choice. Opting between veganism and non veganism is simply NOT our personal choice. We don't live to eat. We eat to live. Look through the eyes of the animals. The moment they are born, someone else has already fixed their day of execution. Preferring taste over someone's life is not justified. Many non vegans will argue. Still, it's our duty to tell them the truth, considering that once we were one of them as well. Opt for vegan alternatives. They taste good too ;)","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-759007236-50-mydanguevmfjfagcbbzbrkusskxvwpbk.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8cf8503888a7283e9f5fb40d6a6ed958-lq']"

Is it unethical to feed non-vegans vegan food without telling them?,"Assuming the following three conditions, no, certainly not. But if we’re talking about serving up a lasagna and not mentioning that it’s made with that cashew stuff they use for vegan ricotta (and there are no tree nut allergies involved), who cares? If it’s “meatballs” that are actually made from mushroom and tofu, who cares? Heck, technically brownies made with non-milk chocolate and oil instead of egg are “vegan brownies”—but they’re also how plenty of non-vegans make brownies. Or something as simple as “mashed potatoes without butter”. Now, don’t get me wrong—I’m a dedicated omnivore. I love dairy products, I love eggs and egg recipes, and when I go to the restaurant, it’s pretty likely that Bessie, Wilbur, or Bambi are going on my plate. I’m also not usually a fan of vegan alternatives. But I’m also not a fan of celery in chicken salad or tuna salad, or unblended tomato chunks in my sauce—yet I don’t expect anyone to take on an affirmative duty to warn whether such things might be in something I may eat. I may decline to finish it when I find out, but if I do, it will be because, after trying it, I didn’t like it—not because I’m shocked and appalled that I accidentally ate something vegan. It literally would not occur to me to be upset at my host for not saying, “Hey, by the way, this is vegan,” or to feel somehow violated. Original Question:

"The doctor says I need to eat more meat, but I’m a vegan. What do I do?","Tell your doctor you are a vegan and ask which specific nutrient deficiencies you have. If your doctor can’t give you any vegan alternatives then you should find a new doctor. It’s possible to get every nutrient on a vegan diet including vitamin B12, DHA, Iron, all essential amino acids, and calcium.

What is a vegan alternative for cat food? Does IAMS have one?,"Although many cats seem to enjoy mashed or roast potato they must have *some* meat in their diet, for the taurine, otherwise they go blind and die. Artificial taurine, not extracted from meat, is currently not as good from what I hear, so if you want to keep an indoor cat you will always have to include some meat in its diet. This is true even for cats with kidney problems who are on a low-protein diet. However, once cultured, lab grown meat becomes commercially available that should have the same taurine content as meat from a dead animal. And if your cat goes outside a lot, is reasonably fit and not declawed, it will probably make its own arrangements regarding a steady supply of meat in the form of mice, frogs, small birds etc.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-120909277-50-hadyiygrjfwsoojfclxzanmbvgifznhx.jpeg']

Why would a vegan be opposed to wearing wool when sheep need to be sheared?,"Because vegans lack common sense, and have no understanding of the natural world. Their existence is only possible in a post-scarcity Western society, where there are lots of vegan alternatives which are only available by raping and bankrupting developing nations for their avocado toast, cutting down rainforest to grow their monoculture soybeans, and destroying and polluting the environment for their cotton clothing and ocean-destroying plastic ‘leather’.

"If vegans and vegetarians are against eating meat, why do they eat meat alternatives, such as vegan sausages and vegetarian bacon?","Because many vegetarians grew up eating meat, so the taste is familiar to them, but also because many of the meat substitutes are high in protein. Yet, no animals were harmed or died in the making of that protein. People evolve. They learn as they grow older. For many of us we have come to an understanding that there is no reason to torture and kill sentient beings to survive anymore. It’s not the caveman days where we were just part of the food chain. Humans are omnivores. That means they can choose to eat meat or not eat meat, (as opposed to cats, for instance.) We have the technology and knowhow to create healthy, good tasting foods out of plant products. Why on earth should we kill and torture animals when we don’t have to?",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-5716224-50-rxbyuqqjdzmmbwmxmgvmppkqzbjifkzn.jpeg']

Is gelatin vegan?,"Oh, my, no. Gelatin, full stop, is made of collagen, a protein extracted from animal bone. It is in no way vegan. There are vegan alternatives to gelatin, which may be labeled as “vegan gelatin” or something which includes the word gelatin but is in some way qualified. These can include carrageenan, agar, pectin, starches and a variety of other thickeners. (Oh, and kosher gelatin is not vegan either. It’s gelatin derived from animals which are kosher.

How do vegans feel about this picture?,"I'm not a vegan, but right off the bat the conclusion is pretty lame. Yes, with the cows dead, they do find commercial and industrial uses for many of the parts. But none of them are without vegan alternatives, or they are things that vegans live without. Some of the assertions are just outright bizarre. I've got no idea how cow blood is supposed to show up in pasta; even if there's some weird industrial byproduct used in pasta manufacturing I assure you the vegans would be ecstatic to live without it. Nor do I have any idea what part of cow blood ends up in cake mix. (It's the eggs that are a lot harder to work around.) They don't need to use animal byproducts to produce charcoal or crayons. I have no conception of what kind of animal-based antifreeze they're using. Most of those products are produced from petroleum. Vegans are well aware that gelatin is made from animal material. They don't eat it. The one who seems unaware about the consequences of veganism is the one who made the poster, not the vegans. If vegans end up using these items incidentally because industry crams it in there, that's not any challenge to their goals. If a vegan is tricked into using an animal byproduct it's a shame on the manufacturers, not them. There are plenty of real challenges to veganism -- such as the fact that they often depend on petroleum, an environmental hazard -- without having to make up stupid stuff.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-243133-50-tfnznqnqwnwbmdsvjxjsfpypedjpnart.jpeg']
What is something a guest in your house did that made your jaw drop? How did you react?,"About a half a dozen years ago, I had invited someone to join my extended family and myself for a holiday dinner. Two days prior to the dinner we received a phone call saying that this person had become vegan. I looked around my kitchen, especially at the turkey and brisket thawing in my sink for the main course, and the chicken in the fridge ready to be made into soup that night. I told my husband that we had to get dressed and go immediately to a large market about an hour away to pick up some tofu main course for this guest. I made a large chicken soup and a small vegan veggie soup especially for this guest. I made the turkey and the brisket, as well as the tofu roast.All of the side dishes were vegan, and the cakes and pie had neither dairy nor shortening. well, the night of the holiday dinner, as I always do, I used my best crystal, china and silver. Since I was hosting a large group, and I make all of the dishes from scratch, my friends and family usually offer to help serve, carry dishes, and other gestures of their appreciation for my efforts. The vegan and her partner never offered to even bring their own plate to the kitchen. No problem. There are enough people offering to help. I made sure that the new vegan was aware of which dishes had meat products. The appetizers were served and eaten. I serve the two different types of soup and had enough to offer the other guests the vegan vegetable If they preferred. There were two different types of salad, with rave reviews. Next was the main course. Well my husband and a friend went about carving the meat, I made sure that the vegan alternative was presented as appealingly as I could. Well, my mistake was that I asked the new vegan if she liked the vegan roast. She looked me straight in the eye and in a rather loud voice replied, “it tastes like shit”. I was so taken aback that all I could say was, “excuse me? “And she replied in an even louder voice (by then there was absolute silence in the dining room), “This taste like shit “ My response was a huge smile, and “I’m sorry you didn’t appreciate it “I then turned to the other guests and asked who would like seconds of the roast or turkey. At the end of the evening, she came up to me and said that she was sorry but it did taste like shit. With my biggest smile, I said it’s a shame it took so much effort when you obviously would’ve enjoyed the vegetable side dishes instead. now, let me tell you who this new vegan was. She was my stepson’s girlfriend. Since then, they’ve gotten married. And no, she appreciates nothing I do. I don’t take it personally. I am not the mother, or the mother-in-law… Just her husband’s stepmother. I refuse to allow her drama to affect my marriage. We are very careful about who we have over when she is around.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-969691035-50-nahzfldcxjrmlzdjoxeuyanlvbzjbkdq.jpeg']

"If I give a cat ""IAMS cat food"" its whole life will it be healthy? Also are there any cat vegan alternative diets? Replace taurine with something vegan perhaps?","Yes, there’s a brand of vegan cat food. It was created by a chiropractor who had his license to practice suspended, has been caught pretending to be a veterinarian
several times, killed a cat who was in his “care” as a “veterinarian,” and was convicted
of making false claims about his pet food while “prescribing” treatments for cats and dogs. Would you like to trust that guy, or the thousands of veterinarians and veterinary nutritionists who point out cats are obligate carnivores? Feeding your cat a vegan diet means you’re condemning your little friend to eventual blindness, internal organ shutdown and a slow, torturous death. Please don’t do it. Don’t take my word for it: Read Rai Khalsa, one of Quora’s resident veterinarians, describe discovering the effects of meat deprivation in cats first-hand. It’s a great read from someone who is an authoritative expert in this area. Other veterinarians here on Quora have weighed in on this topic as well. As for feeding your cat a healthy diet, without getting into specific brands here are a few guidelines: Good luck.

The products might seem expensive if you buy highly processed food or visit any vegan restaurant.

Prepare almond/coconut/cashew/soy mylk. Homemade vegan alternatives are even cheaper than the dairy products. I have even come across a watchman whose entire family is vegan because vegan products are much affordable to them. They buy peanuts worth ₹10 and prepare 1 litre of milk out of it.
