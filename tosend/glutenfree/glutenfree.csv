What’s something you can’t believe you had to explain to another adult?,"I had to explain to a customer that some foods are, and have always been, gluten free. An adult woman came to me with a container of a well known brand of peanut butter and showed me that the label on the container was sporting the blurb “naturally gluten free!”. She told me that she was not on a restricted diet and she wanted to buy regular peanut butter. I explained to her that the product was indeed regular peanut butter but the manufacturer had simply changed the label so that people who ate gluten free would know that product was gluten free. Unfortunately, she did not grasp the concept. I then had what I call “the mad merry-go-round conversation” with the woman, trying to convince her that the product was the same, only the label has been changed. She was still sure that the product had to be different because now that they’ve removed the gluten it can’t be the same. Again I explained that if a product never had gluten to begin with there is no harm in a label saying that it is gluten free and the new label just makes it easier for people who have to eat gluten free. I explained that there were lots of foods that were gluten free and she was probably eating them every day. Well, she didn’t have to eat gluten free and she didn’t want to pay extra for gluten-free products. And just like that I was handed the task of explaining that if a food never had gluten it was already a gluten free food and that would have no effect on the price of the product. SIGH I don’t think I convinced her that day but I do wonder if the light bulb ever lit up.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-145091464-50-euqygewotgyfysyqohtspbnshvhtwhff.jpeg']
What is the dumbest thing a waitress or waiter said to you when you tried to explain to them that your meal needs to be gluten-free?,"I selected a plain baked potato as a vegetable from the menu, since I knew it would be gluten free. I needed this to accompany the rest of my meal, as the salad that was usually served with it had a dressing that contained gluten. I had checked that the potato was not baked with anything else, and not coated in anything or cooked with other things, so I knew it was definitely gluten free from the waitress’s description. However, she kept insisting it would not be gluten free. I asked her to ask the chef. She argued for quite a few minutes, insisting that it would have gluten. She eventually checked with the chef as I asked her to, and came back and confirmed that it would not have gluten. I asked her why she thought it had gluten. She then told me that she has a friend who eats gluten-free foods and who can't eat potato, so she thought all potato must have gluten. I had to explain that gluten comes from certain grains such as wheat, and thus is not in potatoes. Added coatings or dressings could have gluten. Aso her friend may also have a reaction to vegetables in the nightshade family, which includes potato. Edit to add: The dumb thing the waitress said was NOT the initial statement about the potato. The dumbest thing she said was 15 minutes of arguing and adamant refusal to check with the chef and refusal to take my order. Please, I do not want any more Reader’s replying that she was trying to be helpful not dumb. No. She wasn’t. The extended one sided argument made for an unpleasant time and is not the standard of service I expect.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-9382160-50-IF1b27mnicj6ZgtLsmGB0nzSNUbjeXN7.jpeg']

When was the last time you were left completely stunned at a restaurant?,"My 4 yr old daughter and I went out for dinner at Applebee's in Geneseo, NY. My daughter and I played games until the food arrived…which it didn't. After about an hour, I asked the waitress when our food would be ready, and she was very snotty to me. I could tell she was working the larger table for a good tip…little did she know I never leave less than $13 for a tip for the two of us (even if we eat at Denny's). Our “food” finally arrived, and my daughter's kids meal chicken was burned dry yet her brocolli was hard. I'm celiac and ordered salmon plain, no sauce, and they brought it covered in some kind of Hollandaise sauce! I told the waitress I ordered salmon no sauce, and she said the sauce is gluten free. I asked to speak to her manager, and I explained I ordered the salmon with no sauce because I need gluten free, and he said, “Well, how do you know it's not gluten free?” I was stunned that he would question me versus apologizing and remaking the meal. I also pointed out my daughter's burned meal, and he offered no apology. I told him and the waitress I wasn't paying for anything, and we got up and left. I ended up having to make dinner when we got home. I called and spoke with the regional manager, and he mailed me a $10 voucher to make up for it…which definitely did not make things better. I called Applebee's complaint line..twice! And no one returned my call. Needless to say, we have not set foot in an Applebee's in over 4 years.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-267002579-50-kzymmffeemlczhikerfrnyptjwvfvxoj.jpeg']

If you fake allergies for personal dietary choice, yes, I’ll judge.

"What difference does it make to the taste, texture and cooking of a sausage being gluten free?","Tuscan “knife point” sausages Sausage is pork (lean meat and fat) ground or finely diced, occasionally other meats too (beef, horse, or gooose), added with spices or herbs, salt, maybe some wine or beer, and all inserted in pork guts as casing. Gluten free sausages are the norm because there is nothing in sausages to add gluten. Luganega di Monza Some sausages have extra ingredients, for instance luganega di Monza contains some finely grated Grana Padano cheese, or Neapolitan cervellatine contain brains. These usually still don’t contain gluten. Whenever you see a sausage with “Gluten free” printed somewhere you can be sure of either of two things: you are being scammed or you are buying an inferior quality sausage. And most often both things at the same time. Because good sausage is gluten free by definition!","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-956390-50-s5VGN0mUs71cQeEapdJdPhcq41EyfbTA.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42b1d4b60a48334d6f48046cda073808-pjlq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-beea2eab05e6e472b8279286ace202e1-lq']"
"As a waiter or waitress, what is the most ridiculous, obnoxious order that you have ever taken?","This is more a type of person ordering that is super obnoxious. My first serving job was at a vegetarian restaurant. We catered heavily to people with unique diets, food intolerances, and allergies. We had vegan and gluten free options for almost everything on the menu. The most ridiculous and obnoxious thing is when someone is vegan or gluten free and they tell you over and over again while placing their order. Them: “Hi, I’m vegan. What can I eat here?” Me: “I can modify any dish to be vegan, what did you have in mind?” Them: “I was thinking the veggie burger, but it needs to be vegan because I’m vegan.” Me: “Cool, I’ve got vegan cheese and the sauce and bun are already vegan so you’re good to go” Them: “I can’t have cheese, I’m vegan” Me: “… its vegan cheese” Them: “Okay, as long as it’s vegan because I’m veeeegaaan. Are you sure the bun is vegan? I don’t eat anything that isn’t vegan.” Me: “Okay, so I’ve got one burger, extra rare, with extra cheese, extra creamy sauce, and you wanted to add bacon right?” Them: “Didn’t you hear me?! I’m VEEEEEEEEGAAAAAN!!!” Edit: I need to make something clear: I do not hate vegans. I am a vegetarian myself, for 20 years, I spent about 4 of those vegan and at one point I ate a soy-free, gluten-free, raw vegan diet. I think eating vegan is an honorable dietary choice and can be very healthy if you do it right. I also know the struggle of finding food to eat while dining out. What I’m hating on is people who wear their chosen diet like a badge of honor and force it down everyone else’s throat. In the example I gave we were in a vegetarian restaurant, the word “vegan” was plastered all over the menu, every dish had an icon denoting if it was or could be made vegan or gluten free, and we had a vegan bakery in house. I also feel that from my responses any reasonable person could have deduced that I understood she was vegan and I was going to serve her a vegan meal. I also should have realized I was going to draw the ire of people with allergies. If you have a food allergy you should tell your server right away and repeat yourself when you place your order. And repeat yourself again if you feel they either didn’t hear you or weren’t paying attention or whatever the case may be. Your allergy is valid and your safety is important. I do not agree with people saying you shouldn’t go out to eat. And please, please don’t say you’re vegan if you actually have an allergy to dairy and/or eggs. Your food will be treated different based on the information you give. For a vegan dish most kitchens are just going to make sure that no animal meat or byproducts will be in your food. For a dish with an allergy to dairy and/or eggs it will be made with sanitized tools on a sanitized cooktop to prevent cross-contamination. Same goes for choosing to eat gluten-free vs. having an actual gluten allergy or celiac disease. Anytime I take a gluten-free order I ask if it’s celiac disease, it is alarming how many people neglect to give this information. If you tell me you have celiac disease I’m going to light up your ticket with this information and relay that info to every person serving you. Your ticket will read “ALLERGY**CELIAC**” on every item you plan to consume. The only thing a gluten-free ticket says is “gluten-free”. It will get no special treatment beyond that.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-82939854-50-cqexoclkgxjvjjxtjjgvflsyauibhrwk.jpeg']

Many food companies and restaurants won't guarantee their food to be gluten free due to potential cross-contamination. What are the risks for people with coeliac disease?,"My best friend is a coeliac — about 3 months ago, I got a very distressed text (i.e. full of an impressive number of expletives) because her apparently gluten free meal wasn't gluten free. We don't quite know if it was a low level contamination of the ingredients, or if the chefs just ballsed up and put something totally non-gluten free in the meal. Nonetheless, the results were not pretty. I didn't quite realise how bad coeliac sufferers were affected by it — so it was a bit of an education for me! A few weeks later when my uncle started lamenting about how eating bread was making him feel drowsy so he must have coeliac's disease I was….not as sympathetic as I might have been! Prior to this incident, my friend has had very few issues with gluten-free-not-being-gluten-free. She says she's never had any shop-bought stuff affect her (except when she was a dope and didn't realise that something had gluten in it!), she's had a few incidents in restaurants — mostly it's cases where “incidental” bits of the meal that nobody thought to check were gluten free. One time a pizza place got her because they kneaded her (gluten free) dough on a table covered in normal flour! The risks are low enough that it doesn't stop her going out for meals, but she generally sticks to larger chain establishments, because they tend to be better at making sure stuff is actually kept uncontaminated.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-88603921-50-becfzzxabfjslqkxdpzgpuvhigoeebvb.jpeg']

Typical gluten free foods are bread, pasta, cake, biscuits, rolls and ingredients in things like sausages and burgers. The gluten free version is always more expensive and is generally not as nice.

Why is gluten free bread so much more expensive than regular bread?,"Let’s first understand what is gluten
. Gluten is not a poison, it’s a natural protein that is present, in variable amount, in wheat (including spelt, khorasan, emmer, einkorn, and triticale); barley, rye, and oats. This protein makes these cereals more nutritious than the others, but also give them a unique possibility. When kneaded with water, the flour of these cereals creates a mass that holds in air and other gasses. If you add to it a raising agent such as yeast or sourdough, this feeds off the sugars in the flour creating a gass as a byproduct that remains trapped into the dough, making it lighter and fluffier (and also tastier). A regular, good quality bread loaf is made with only four ingredients: wheat flour, water, yeast or sourdough, and a pinch of salt. That’s it: basic, natural, simple ingredients. Add a little experience and a good oven and you get this result. Gluten free bread, though, can’t be made with wheat flour, it must be made with flours with no gluten. These flours are usually made from rice, pulses, potatoes or other odd ingredients. You can’t add yeast or sourdough to them because they don't contain gluten, so you have to use artificial leavening agents, which do not help the flavor of the bread to mature, they just add some fizz. Containing no gluten (so no proteins), the gas created by the raising agent would easily escape the dough, resulting in a pasty, heavy bread, so you have to add a binding agent, such as xanthan gum or egg whites. Now we have a bread that is light and fluffy, but tastes nothing like bread because it contains no wheat, the dough hasn’t matured thanks to the yeast, and because you also had to add in a binder. To make it taste better you also have to add other ingredients such a salt, sugar, and fats. The resulting ingredient list looks something like this: So, you went from an extremely natural bread made with just 4 natural and very common ingredients to… Well, that. Many more ingredients, not all of them very healthy, most much more costly than the ingredients you can find in a good, natural, artisanal bread. Besides, to produce gluten-free bread you need to go through a much more complicated procedure, the area where you produce gluten-free bread or other baked goods must be scrupulously clean and surveilled to prevent contamination, the market is much smaller so you don’t have the economies of scale advantage. Gluten-free breads are a product that is specifically geared to those who suffer from celiac disease or similar conditions. They can’t help but use this much lower quality product. In most European countries they also receive funds to be able to purchase these much more costly products they can’t do without. Be kind and allow those who suffer from these very serious conditions access to their own products. If you are healthy and don’t suffer from any of them, you can easily buy much healthier and also much cheaper regular bread.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-956390-50-s5VGN0mUs71cQeEapdJdPhcq41EyfbTA.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e497b764ff576e9068bb286981da7c7-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ca402e60e09422bcb203c6059064e9f9-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8b86b14ee9d84e8b25b906337f24db1-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6691ed9d4022f242922d74a50a389d8-lq']"
"Why do most restaurants add an up charge when ""gluten free"" pasta is requested?","Original question: Why do most restaurants add an up charge when ""gluten free"" pasta is requested? When they say ‘gluten free’.. they mean gluten free. The pasta is far more expensive than usual pasta (and you also get less). The area used to prepare the meal has to be 100% free of gluten.. never mind the food itself. Essentially the restaurants (and also private homes) needs their own area for gluten free products (they might either have a separate area or they need to clean the chosen area down properly at least twice before use.. and then wash everything that’s about to be used in the dishwasher (or at least make sure there’s no chance its been contaminated. Just a single mistake (say just touching something or someone adding flour to a dough they’re kneading that’s a little too close+) can be enough for someone to become quite ill afterwards (depending on how sensitive they are). .. Once the area has been properly cleaned (and the same with the tools) they also need to ensure that there’s no trace of gluten in whatever they use for the meal (which does include their own ingredients (as in opening new ones if the oil or whatever you plan to use has been used for meals with wheat or in an area where there’s been products containing gluten products).. And lets just say that that’s not always as simple as it looks (everything has to be checked and sometimes there’s other names/words for gluten and wheat+ than the obvious ones. .. Including spices and even butter (if they prepare something containing gluten in the same factory they can’t guarantee there’s no traces of it in whatever else is prepared there). .. Never mind that cooking gluten free is a pain unless the original recipe was gluten free to start with (the taste is not the best either.. never mind how ‘easy’ it is to make healthier options unless you go partially low carb or similar (say using a cauliflower pizza crust instead of a dough one or similar). Gluten free is complicated and expensive essentially and it requires a lot of attention to detail that makes the additional cost ..understandable. Unfortunately. (a friend is mine has celiacs.. and just trace amounts of gluten makes said friend extremely sick for days and can even cause permanent damage given a little bad luck. And just to be clear; if you don’t have gluten intolerance or gluten allergy or similar (as in your doctor advised you to eat such or you have a condition where it might be beneficial) there’s no real health benefits to going gluten free (if you suspect you have it.. get yourself tested before you go gluten-free.. If you don’t you’ll have to eat a lot of gluten over a longer period of time to get an accurate test.. and if you were right.. wince). Quite the contrary as gluten free products often have a lot of stuff added to make it taste better (and I don’t mean healthy ingredients but things like extra fats and sugars and more.. and forget about fiber unless the stuff you eat has some kind of gluten-free fiber added). On top of that normal wheat flour has added minerals and such that are beneficial for you while the gluten free flour.. well.. its not the same. While in a way I’m glad that more people are choosing to eat free from diets for no medical reasons (except when we’re talking about children being fed such without a medical diagnosis.. which can affect their development when parents don’t really understand the difference between gluten free vs a normal diet with gluten..).. as that means my friend has far more options what was once available .. On the other hand it also makes it harder to eat out (even if there’s more options) as many restaurants are less careful since there’s so many that don’t actually need to eat gluten free and therefore may consume food or drink that contain gluten (like beer) while still ordering a gluten-free meal. .. So.. Going gluten-free just because?

Is pasta healthier for you if it's gluten free?,"No. Gluten is just a protein.

There’s surely a market for organic, non-GMO, all-natural, gluten-free asbestos.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-4885040-50-stUmLZrbJDTFFYfUXxtcCfdsL9q7OeQc.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cc4b39346efcf19611edc2029002d765-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b48f13756d668a9cce5ff7d2a875bc71-lq']"
What can I do if I’m the only gluten-free person at a party?,"If you are a diagnosed Celiac you either notify the host with enough time for them to make accommodations, or you avoid the foods that may have gluten.

My wife says cleaning the house for her is romantic. Is it?,"I'll tell you what is definitely unromantic: not listening to your wife and trying to get a bunch of internet strangers to contradict her. Your beloved has made a request. It's easy to honor. It's inexpensive. It's a responsible activity. It's even low calorie and gluten free! This isn't that hard. I've done the laundry, most of the cooking, and a fair subset of other chores throughout 23 years of marriage. From all appearances, my wife finds it very conducive to romance.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-38709882-50-ystomutgyckhjvxqitrllzjbnhmrwxyr.jpeg']
"Is gluten bad for everyone, and should I go gluten-free even if I don't suffer any symptoms?","Absolutely not. Humans have been eating gluten since we found out that grass seeds are edible, and the rise of agriculture led to explosive evolution of our digestion: genes for digesting gluten doubled and doubled again, so we are now very efficient at digesting it. On average, that is. If you do suffer symptoms, and especially if you have seen a doctor about it to confirm that gluten intolerance is indeed your problem, then you should of course refrain from eating gluten.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-171207913-50-nuvrqsmqmbtmomaogamujiulbffsybnj.jpeg']
What does gluten do in wheat flour?,"First of all what is gluten? It is not a poison or an additive, it’s just the natural proteins of the wheat (and other grains, not all grains). It’s an important nutrient and perfectly healthy for most people. The “network” created by gluten in a dough When you make a dough, kneading the gluten creates a net structure that gives cohesion to the dough and make it strong, so that it does not melt while boiling. If you knead a bread, the gluten makes it possible for the dough to ferment with the help of yeast or sourdough. The gluten traps in the gasses produced by this fermentation and create a light, flavorful bread. Gluten-free flours can’t create this structure, so the dough can’t trap the gasses created by the fermentation. This means that in order to make gluten-free bread one must add “adhesives” like egg or Arabic gum (or other less healthy additives), and flavors to make the tastes more agreeable.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-956390-50-s5VGN0mUs71cQeEapdJdPhcq41EyfbTA.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42537d480c906237d2852021c3edb775-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-06c9afbcddac2d6b96d7a0ea32f37747-lq']"

Gluten-free food is food that people with Coeliac disease can eat without suffering agonising bloating, diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and cramps.

"My bread says “contains traces of gluten, wheat, and yeast”, not “May”. I attempt to buy bread without gluten, wheat, or yeast in the ingredients. Does this mean that these items are significant in my product or is it just an allergen warning?","It is an allergen warning. Now, if you have celiac disease, you can't eat this bread, and that's it. If you don't, nor suffer from non-celiac gluten sensitivity (supposing that it actually exists, but let's err on the side of caution), you have absolutely no reason to avoid gluten. Indeed, you have all reasons to stay away from gluten-free products. What is gluten? It’s just a protein. It’s actually the main protein in wheat flour, and allows things like proofing. When you knead your dough, it forms strands like those above that kind of “tie” the dough together and make it texturally whole. As you have added yeast or sourdough to your dough, you can then proof it. Yeast is a microorganism that essentially eats some of the starch in your dough and produce gases that make the bread dough rise and become light and fluffy. Besides, they change the taste of the dough, making it more delicious without adding flavorings. A good bread is indeed made only with four ingredients: flour, water, yeast or sourdough, and a pinch of salt. If your dough has enough gluten, and it has been properly developed, the gases produced while proofing will be secured inside the dough, which (as said) will become airy, light, fluffy, and produce a delicious bread. But if your dough does not have enough gluten (or has no gluten at all), the gases escape, and it will not rise. In other words, if your bread has the right amount of gluten, and it has been developed properly, it will look like this once baked, and it will be delicious even if it is made with only the abovementioned four ingredients. What happens when you try to make bread without gluten (or with not enough gluten)? Without gluten, the dough will not be able to “knit” itself and hold in enough gases. The result will be a stodgy, heavy, flavorless mess. In order to make gluten-free bread rise, you need to add to the dough extra ingredients (such as cellulose derivatives, natural and edible gums, food glues such as fish glue, etc.) that hold in the gases. Besides, they don’t work well with yeast or sourdough, so they are usually raised artificially, which in turn prevents the dough from maturing and becoming naturally delicious. As a consequence, gluten-free breads have flavorings such as fats, sugar, etc. added to enhance their flavor. Gluten-free breads and other foods are a necessity for people who have very specific conditions, but they are not healthier than a good quality artisanal loaf. They have a much higher glycemic index, far less fiber, they are poor in proteins, and much richer in fats. Unless you are celiac (in which case you should not eat any food that isn’t allowed for celiacs) you should always avoid gluten-free products if you want to eat a healthy diet.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-956390-50-s5VGN0mUs71cQeEapdJdPhcq41EyfbTA.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42537d480c906237d2852021c3edb775-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-35a911931cbd7c9782b3c09649e299f6', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d1da87587504423a8a913d3d52958e19-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee60d62204196740c84ea49c78cfe626-lq']"
