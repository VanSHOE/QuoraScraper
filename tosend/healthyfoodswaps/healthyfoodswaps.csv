How do you talk to your daughter about her weight gain?,"Don't talk to her about weight gain. When I was a heavy tween, my mother (who didn't mean to hurt me, I know) always told me to suck in my stomach, and always compared me to girls who lost weight (""Have you seen how thin Sami is? You guys used to be the same size!""). Fast forward a few years, I lost weight, but could never stop feeling chubby, never mind the fact that I went down to a size 4 in high school. I spent a month in the hospital with pneumonia, and emerged weighing 110 pounds, which is nothing, considering I'm 5'8. I was stick-thin. And still, I felt chubby, even though I look at pictures and can't believe just how thin I looked. Unknowingly, my mother scarred me for life (no drama intended), and to this day I feel fat, no matter what size I wear. Instead, talk to her about habits. Encourage her to go outside, and to take up a sport. In fact, go for walks with her! If you guys have a dog, take it out for walks together. Make plans to go hiking, and to do other activities that involve any kind of physical effort. Make healthy food swaps in your home. Stop buying soda, or here's a nice little trick: make it a rule that whoever wants a glass of soda has to drink a glass of water first. 9 times out of 10, the soda won't be wanted anymore. Make sure you buy whole-wheat, high-fiber bread, and swap cookies and cereal full of sugar for healthier alternatives. And, above all, set the example. Your daughter knows she's overweight. She doesn't need anyone telling her that, or talking to her about that. Instead, she needs to see her parents being healthy, so she knows how. She just might surprise you.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-130651078-50-nnlanpvtejtgriihtwgsbgjecvexheir.jpeg']

Why is healthy food expensive?,"A few reasons. One, what you are labeling as unhealthy is more efficiently mass produced than some of the other things you mentioned. It takes more to grow organic than not. It takes more to serve fresh than with preservatives. Two, demand. Industries have found ""healthy eaters"" will pay a premium to eat ""better food,"" so if they market their food as healthier they can charge more for about equal effort and suffer no loss. You have bought into the hype. Avoiding trans fat is good so the oil swap is smart. The white bread thing is a marketing gimmick going back a hundred years switching back and forth about whether white or wheat is healthier for various reasons. The organic thing is pure marketing.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-31030660-50-satifypbkddokrwombnetbcrgkgzyzzk.jpeg']

What are some healthy food swaps to attain weight loss?,"Consuming the right set of food items is extremely necessary as eating unhealthy food for a long duration will cause obesity. Today, we will recommend 6 healthy food swaps that will help you keep extra calories at bay: Swap- Muffins and Cupcakes With- Oats with a handful of fresh fruits People having a sweet tooth often take a bite of a cupcake or muffins to satiate hunger pangs. Instead of these calorie, laden treats switch it for a bowl of oatmeal with cherries or strawberries. Swap- Fruit Flavored Yogurt With- Plain yogurt or curd with plenty of fruits Fruit-flavored yogurts are not only overpriced but also over-sweetened. Try to settle for the same portion of plain flavored yogurt. For the fruity flavors, feel free to toss as many fruits you like. With- Roasted peanut or popcorns or walnuts Chips are the most consumed snacks, especially among the youth. It is abundantly available in every mini to mega stores and in every proportion as well. Substitute the crunchy snacks with a handful of roasted peanut or popcorns, while walnuts would be an excellent substitute. Swap- Mayonnaise With- Mustard or hummus or homemade spread Let it be sandwich or burger, using some or the other spread is almost imminent. Instead of calorie-loaded mayonnaise, try out mustard and hummus, or at least a homemade spread using healthier substitutes. Swap- Full plate of pasta With- Half plate pasta tossed with half plate vegetables Though food like pasta and spaghetti should be restricted as much as possible, removing it altogether might be challenging, especially being so delicious. Instead, reduce the proportion by half and fill the other half with fresh vegetables to compensate for the amount. Swap- Cocktail/ Margarita With- Light beer Though substituting alcoholic beverage altogether with nutritious drinks like milk, buttermilk, and coconut water would have been excellent, we are focusing of swapping not transforming. Instead, replace cocktails or margarita etc. with a serving of light beer. By making these aforementioned food changes, you will be able to make significant changes","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-353878898-50-zftbktddsptcxavgudvwlbumswcmoqtd.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7146c75be64027864f30f4fe9d06a08e-pjlq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4a67c2c2f93f563b851caaa431e170c5-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fdba016f24aed3e71c2778d7df56e574-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-86c5d2dd6c8de4c112f6d92ce7ae4c32-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8c69807b8c82dad3ed2a8be83a4a7ce0-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b38c89144000af18949813d52acdce7b-lq']"
What foods are good for your health?,"Healthy Eating Healthy eating is not about strict dietary limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it‚Äôs about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and stabilizing your mood. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you‚Äôre not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you‚Äôll find another saying exactly the opposite. But by using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create a tasty, varied, and healthy diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body. Moderation is key Key to any healthy diet is moderation. But what is moderation? In essence, it means eating only as much food as your body needs. You should feel satisfied at the end of a meal, but not stuffed. Moderation is also about balance. Despite what fad diets would have you believe, we all need a balance of protein, fat, fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to sustain a healthy body. Cut back on sugar Aside from portion size, perhaps the single biggest problem with the modern Western diet is the amount of added sugar in our food. As well as creating weight problems, too much sugar causes energy spikes and has been linked to diabetes, depression, and even an increase in suicidal behaviors in young people. Reducing the amount of candy and desserts you eat is only part of the solution as sugar is also hidden in foods such as bread, cereals, canned soups and vegetables, pasta sauce, margarine, instant mashed potatoes, frozen dinners, low-fat meals, fast food, and ketchup. Your body gets all it needs from sugar naturally occurring in food so all this added sugar just means a lot of empty calories. Eat plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily minimum of five servings of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A serving is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the amount we currently eat. To increase your intake, add berries to breakfast cereals, eat fruit for dessert, swap your usual side dish for a salad, and snack on vegetables such as carrots, snow peas, or cherry tomatoes instead of processed snack foods.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-226021237-50-lczmmfcgvkadwxvgkoqkzftyydcrdpgl.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-889d1bb6acdf77321194b7a347c95ad2.webp']"
What are some cheap foods that are also healthy?,"It's easy: learn how to shop and learn how to cook. I'm going to tell you how to save a fortune and eat healthier as a by-product. Bear with me until the end. First, some context. I developed these methods over years of being a poor student and from my frugal parents. I cook all of our family dinners and each one typically only costs about ¬£1 per person. First a few life hacks that will get you big savings with almost no effort required: Now for some examples. You could buy a tomato pasta sauce costing ¬£1.49. Cheap and healthy yeah? It was on special offer, so you got a great deal. Wrong. Buy a tin of chopped tomatoes (30p) add some dried herbs/chili flakes/whatever (5p) and tomato puree (5p) and cook it on the hob for 10 minutes. There. Healthier and cheaper. Tastier too. The tinned tomatoes and herbs are also flexible. Fancy Mexican instead of Italian? Add sliced chilis, paprika, kidney beans (20p) and cumin. Boom. Different meal. The most expensive components of a meal are usually alcoholic drinks and meat/fish/seafood. A bottle of wine is say ¬£5 and meat costs perhaps ¬£5‚Äì15 per kilo (half that for cost per lb). Swap these out: drink beer or cider instead (¬£1.49 a bottle) and drink it by the glass, like wine. You'll drink a lot less a to boot, which is healthier. Consider changing to a cheaper meat. For example, if some diced beef costs ¬£10 per kilo, consider swapping it for chicken fillets at ¬£6 per kilo. You could go further and reduce the cost and meat content by replacing some/all of it with other cheaper protein like eggs, mushrooms, soya or nuts. Mushrooms only cost about ¬£2 per kilo and are very nutritious, for example. Bulk out your meals with vegetables. This makes each meal portion both cheaper and healthier. 50% of each meal should be vegetables. No, potatoes don't count. Here's a full example of the power of this approach. The savings in time and money are enormous: Spaghetti bolegnese (my favourite) Meal out: Garlic bread ¬£5, spaghetti bolegnese ¬£10, glass of wine, ¬£7 Total cost per portion: ¬£22 Taste: 9/10 Heath: 7/10 Lazy shopping and cooking: Fresh garlic bread ¬£1, ready meal spaghetti bolegnese ¬£4, 1/3 bottle of wine ¬£2 Total cost per portion: ¬£7 Taste: 4/10 Heath: 3/10 Normal shopping and cooking: Frozen garlic bread 50p, beef mince 50p, 1/2 an onion (from a pack of 3) 25p, brand name spaghetti bolegnese sauce ¬£1.50, brand name spaghetti 15p, grated cheese (from a bag) 20p, 1/3 bottle of wine ¬£2 Total cost per portion: ¬£4.10 Taste: 6/10 Heath: 6/10 Healthy and cheap shopping and cooking: French bread 20p, butter 5p, garlic 5p (for home made garlic bread - much healthier and nicer), beef mince (bigger pack, cheaper cost per kilo) 30p, 1/4 onion (loose) 10p, tins of chopped tomatoes 10p, herbs 5p, peppers 10p, mushrooms (loose) 10p, own brand spaghetti 5p, cheese (grated at home) 10p, 1 bottle of beer ¬£1.50 Total cost per portion: ¬£2.65 and most of that is the beer. ¬£1.15 is the food cost per portion. Taste: 9/10 Heath: 9/10 Simple changes lead to big savings over time. My friends always wonder how I have money when they have none; I know how to shop and I make our meals from scratch. Those ¬£ saved every day all add up over time. Just ¬£1 saving a day is ¬£365 a year. Imagine how much you could save‚Ä¶",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-24114277-50-nqnoyorbylbcuwcalpwolifuibxreucg.jpeg']

Why does junk food typically seem less expensive than healthy food?,"It's not (at least in the UK). Some healthy food is expensive, some are cheap, some junk food is cheap, and some are expensive. For background, I am an 18 year student and I make sure that pretty much every meal I eat costs less than ¬£1 a serving. I rarely ever meal prep due to limited freezer space and me being lazy. I'll include some meal ideas at the bottom of the answer. (The following food is with approximate Tesco prices unless I say otherwise). As I cook for just myself, I mainly have frozen veg as otherwise it will go off before I get to eat it. You can get a kilo bag of frozen peas for 40‚Äì50p in Tesco, frozen green beans for around an extra 10p, and lots of different combinations of mixed veg for around 70p. For (healthy) snacks, I buy a kilo of carrots for 40‚Äì50p, and can buy a bunch of bananas that will last me the week for 70‚Äì80p, and a punnet of grapes for ¬£1. If I am eating fresh veg with my dinner that weak, I can buy a bag of kale for 40p and mushrooms for I think 80p , and I lightly fry them in Tesco own brand low calorie oil spray (90p) and some garlic granules and a little bit of salt. For carbs, you can buy a loaf of wholemeal bread for 36p, a kilo of pasta for 37p, rice is extremely cheap too. If you want instant oats, all you need to do is just get some normal porridge oats, pour some into a bowl, and a splash of boiling water and wait a couple of mins for the oats to absorb the water, and voila you basically have porridge without cooking anything. Pasta only takes 10 minutes to cook, but if you want even more convenient carbs, you can get microwave bags that take 1‚Äì2mins max to cook of rice, mixed grains, or lentils for a ¬£1 each. For me they are 2 portions a bag so they work out at 50p per dinner, not including what I eat it with (I'll get on to some meal ideas later). Obviously you can just buy a whole bag of rice or lentils for the same price but you're paying extra for the convenience here. You can also buy tins of beans such as butter beans (30p a can in Lidl) which cook in just 3 mins and I use as a carb in a meal. I feel full after just eating half a tin, and they also count as 1 of your 5 a day. For protein, I buy tins of sardines in sauce for 40p each (22g of protein a tin if I remember correctly), bag of frozen chicken breasts for ¬£3.50 (I think it was a kilo and had roughly 7 in it?), bags of salmon fillets for ¬£3.30 (only 4 small ones but I use it to make a creamy salmon pasta meal which I'll get on to later), and frozen haddock (I think?) at half the price, if I remember correctly, that gives me 2‚Äì3 servings a bag depending on how I've cooked them. I also buy breaded chicken breasts, which I know people will be snobby about however I've checked that it's 100% chicken breast meat and I don't have a problem with it having some bread crumbs on it as you likely eat a sandwich for lunch so what's the difference? You can get a lower quality bag of 8 breaded fillets for 90p, where for a dinner I would eat 3 so it works out at 30p a dinner for my protein. Or you can buy higher quality breaded chicken breasts at ¬£1.60 for a box of 4, where 2 is enough for me so it costs 80p per dinner for my protein. I buy sausages at ¬£1.10 for a pack of 12 (Lidl, I think it's ¬£1.30 at Tesco), and for a more unique protein source, you can buy soy bean/ black bean spaghetti at Aldi. It costs ¬£2 a box, which is expensive for pasta, however the box has 4 servings each and each serving is 22‚Äì30g of protein, so you are effectively eating the same amount of protein as a large chicken breast for 50p. ** When I say my meals cost less than ¬£1, they all do apart from meals I occasionally make where I've used ‚Äúspecial"" ingredients such as salmon or red meat, but they still all cost less than ¬£1.30 a serving. MEAL IDEAS: (I'll add them as I think of them) CONVENIENCE MEALS (In under 5 mins): Tinned sardines in sauce with microwave grains and microwave veg- pour peas into a bowl with a splash of water, cover and microwave for 2 mins. Add Tesco own brand sardines and sauce to the bowl and microwave for another minute covered. Take bowl out and keep covered. Now put the bag of Tesco own brand microwave rice/lentils in the microwave and follow it's instructions. And boom, you've just made a healthy microwave meal with almost 30g of protein at just over 90p a serving with no washing up apart from the plate you eat off. Could experiment with different tins of fish in different sauces (although would make this more expensive), and can use different/multiple veg. Also frozen haddock fillets take 3‚Äì5 mins to cook in the microwave however you might want to out some seasoning on them or use a condiment sauce because in my opinion the taste is not brilliant. EASY FAIRLY QUICK MEALS (Under 20 mins with low involvement): Breaded chicken with pesto (90p for a jar of reduced fat) pasta or butter beans, and some steamed veg. Literally just shove the chicken in the oven according to instructions and do the rest when you need to. Can swap the meat with what you see on offer and use sauces such as low fat mayo. Costs 35p-¬£1 a serving depending on what meat and side you use. MEALS WITH MORE EFFORT (But gives multiple servings which you can reheat or freeze for another time): Sausage casserole pasta- fry half a pack of sausages with the oil spray (takes about 25mins, grill would be better but mine is broken). Take sausages out of pan. Fry some onion and any veg you may have such as mushrooms or peppers, and start to boil the pasta in another pan. Then add a tin of chopped tomatoes to the lightly fried veg, and any frozen veg such as peas or spinach. Bring to the boil and then turn heat down. Pour in some drained butter beans and can add oregano too. Add the sausages but slice them before. Within a few mins of adding the butter beans everything is cooked. Gives me roughly 3 servings and costs less than 50p a serving. Healthy burgers and potato wedges- cut potato into wedges. Boil for 10/15 mins. Drain and mix with some oil and seasoning (such as Cajun or peri peri). Put on tray (I use a mesh one) and put in the oven for around 30 mins. Meanwhile for burgers, get a pack of some 5% beef mince (can also use higher fat which is cheaper). Break the mince up. Add a couple of sliced spring onion (don't have to do this) and some seasoning (you have to do this). Mix and form burger patties which you want as flat as you can. Lightly fry using the low calorie oil spray and should take less than 10 mins. If I remember correctly a 500g pack of lean 5% mince costs ¬£2.59 at Tesco with an Aldi price match and gives me 6 burgers? So for me that's 3 servings a pack. Also serve some steamed veg or salad. Whole dinner costs around ¬£1 but can make it cheaper and quicker using a different carb as a side as the potato wedges take the longest (eg if you used pasta, that only takes 10 mins to cook so whole dinner could be made in around 15 mins) Lentil curry- fry some onion, and garlic and ginger if you want but I usually don't bother. Then add around a third of a kilo bag of red lentils, a reduced fat tin of coconut milk, some curry powder and some boiling water. Bring to the boil, and some frozen spinach, and then simmer. The longer you leave it to simmer and for the lentils to soak up the liquid (keep adding boiling water), the more servings you have. Takes 30- ideally 40 mins. This usually gives me around 4 servings, and costs less than 70p a serving. Could replace coconut milk with a tin of chopped tomatoes to reduce cost. Creamy salmon pasta- Put frozen bag of salmon in oven according to instructions but take out 5 mins early. Fry about 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and some onion. Add salmon, a small tub of reduced fat creme fraiche, a very small amount of boiling water and a stock cube. Can also add frozen peas or steam the veg seperatly. Serve with pasta. Gives me 4 servings and costs around ¬£1.20 a serving.",['https://qsf.cf2.quoracdn.net/-4-images.new_grid.profile_default.png-26-688c79556f251aa0.png']

What are some healthy foods that you should eat frequently?,"Idli, also known as iddly, is a steamed cake made from rice and black lentils originating from Southern India. Idlis are made in a specialized mold and eaten with chutney, vegetable stew or other flavorful toppings for breakfast or as a snack. These small treats are good for you and, as a bonus, convenient for those on the go. To make your diet a bit healthier, swap a donut or muffin for an idli. Ingredients and Tips Idli are made from cooked white rice, black lentils and a pinch of salt. No oil is required, as the steaming process prevents the batter from sticking to the mold. To eliminate most of the sodium, skip the salt at the cost of flavor. For more fiber, use brown rice instead of white -- brown rice does create a grainier texture and turns idlis tan rather than their usual white color. One idli is one serving and weighs about 0.75 ounce, though with their low-caloric content, average diets easily accommodate a helping of two. Calories, Fat, Sodium and Cholesterol Each idli contains just 39 calories, which is a minimal amount in comparison to a healthy 2,000-calorie daily diet. Idlis contain no fat, no saturated fat and no cholesterol. Consuming less than 16 grams of saturated fat and 300 milligrams of cholesterol lessens your risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. From the salt, each idli does contain about 65 milligrams of sodium. Doctor recommends no more than 2,300 milligrams per day to prevent high blood pressure. Protein, Fiber and Carbohydrates In a single idli, you consume 2 grams of protein, 2 grams of dietary fiber and 8 grams of carbohydrates. For a light snack, that is a notable amount of protein and fiber with minimal carbohydrates. Healthy adults need 50 grams of protein and 225 grams of carbohydrates daily. Adequate protein facilitates muscle repair, and carbohydrates provide energy. Fiber promotes healthy digestion and bulks stool -- men need between 28 and 34 grams of fiber and women between 22 and 28 grams daily. Vitamins and Minerals One idli contains 1 milligram of iron, and trace amounts of calcium, folate, potassium and vitamin A. The iron is mostly from the black lentils, with about 25 percent of it from the rice. Iron keeps your blood oxygenated and is crucial for any diet. Men need 8 milligrams daily and women 18 milligrams. Have you heard about an idli diet? There is a non-technical diet named after idli.

What are some heart-healthy pizza recipes?,"The problem is not the recipe, it is the quality of the raw materials, the technique, and the portion. I have just seen on Youtube a guy making ‚Äúcrustless pizza‚Äù, presenting it as a healthier version. It was basically a bunch of processed cheese with processed spices, processed meats, and not a gram of vegetables in sight. Pizza can be an acceptably healthy food, as long as it‚Äôs made properly and eaten in moderate amounts, in a meal that includes vegetables and fruits. The bread base (what you call the crust) should be made with a very simple and well-hydrated bread dough, made with only a mixture of durum and regular wheat flours, neither too thin nor bleached. This kind of flour has more proteins and fibers (even though it‚Äôs not whole wheat) than all-purpose flour. The bread should also include water, yeast or sourdough, and a pinch of salt, and should be fermented for 24 hours for a perfect raise, with good flavor and to make it easy to digest. It should be topped with excellent quality crushed tomatoes, a little fresh mozzarella, or better, fiordilatte, and a light drizzle of extravirgin olive oil, and baked for just a few minutes at the highest temperature possible. This creates a light, tasty and not greasy pizza. For an even healthier meal you may consider swapping the tomato sauce for a mixture of bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and fresh tomatoes, all diced or cut in thin slices and saut√©ed with extravirgin olive oil and a garlic clove. Distribute this mixture on the pizza, topping with a few bits of fresh mozzarella, and bake.
