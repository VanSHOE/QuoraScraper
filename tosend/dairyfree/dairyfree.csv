Can you refuse to eat at a family dinner?,"My daughter does all the time. Because her “family” refuses to take her food allergies seriously and maintain safe food practices. For example, cutting the dairy free cheesecake with the same knife that cut the pecan pie, rendering the only dessert she could eat now inedible (she’s allergic to all nuts) So, we bring McDonald’s or pizza or whatever to family dinners because it is the only way she can safely eat without worrying about dying.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-405889801-50-rkduebgpqpwkvreihvofpfsyjmnsmliu.jpeg']

Do teachers judge parents by the lunches they send their kids to school with?,"My son is allergic to milk (NOT lactose-intolerant) so he took his lunch every day. He often had things like burritos or tacos, made at home, and always fruit and a juice box or a bottle of water. One teacher complained that he never had cheese or yogurt like most kids and I had to tell her to check his file. Those things could kill him! She assured me that everybody needed some dairy every day and reminded me that lactose free foods were available. I told my son not to eat anything she wanted to add to his lunch and referred her to the school nurse who was familiar with his reaction to dairy. It was life-threatening! The nurse reported that the woman didn't believe her either. Fortunately, my son remembered well the time his father bought him a hot dog that had milk in the bun. He ate hot dogs at home (dairy-free) all the time and hubby just never thought to check. Fortunately they got to me pretty quickly, I had the epi-pen and inhaler, and he threw up most of it as well. He never wanted to feel that way again, in pain and struggling to breathe! He wouldn't eat anything not approved by Mom. Saved his life more than once, I am sure.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-ti-1720245-50-kqlffakorwbroqenqwwnhzjavzptdzhn.jpeg']
"Is Mayo dairy free? If yes, what are some brands?","Far from it. Mayo has a strong dairy industry especially in the limestone country in the east where grass grows thick and lush in the mild, moist climate. Western Mayo is less agrifriendly and mostly blanket bog. (if you meant mayonnaise, which is named after Mahón the capital of the Spanish island of Menorca and thus nothing to so with Ireland, and it doesn’t take an initial capital, then you should have said. If you make it yourself as you should you use oil, egg yolk and either vinegar or lemon juice, so it’s dairy free. Branded jars of mayonnaise also contain all kinds of preservatives, colourings and other additives which are alien to proper food, so I won’r recommend any. Especially not those that look suspiciously lacking in egg yolks.

But other than that, my life didn’t change much. No health benefits that I noticed.

What diet change did you make that drastically improved your health?,"I was always considered as a ""good kid"" or an ""ideal kid"" because- 1. I was good at academics (Yes! Good old days). 2. I was very obedient (which I still am). 3. I used to DRINK MILK EVERYDAY WITHOUT CREATING ANY SCENE. Opposite was the case with my brother. He still hates drinking milk, and I still love it. Years passed by, and that milk with Bournvita got replaced by milk with coffee powder. I consumed 2 mugs of coffee everyday (which might be unhealthy i know), with PURE MILK, period. Then, from last 2-3 years, I actually started feeling unhealthy all the time. I started feeling like something is wrong with my system. I got my blood tested, and everything was fine (by god’s grace). But I was still feeling that there’s something wrong happening with my body. I started eating dinner early, as I thought it could be the possible reason for me not feeling good from inside. And honestly speaking, it actually helped me! I started feeling a little better, but I still felt there’s something wrong with me. I stopped consuming coffee. Again started drinking Bournvita (haha). Nothing changed. I just started feeling sleepy at some parts of the day. Then, I stopped adding sugar to my coffee. Maybe, the nasty sugar was making me feel that way. I agree that sugar is bad, but it actually didnt show any significant wonders once I stopped consuming it (just sharing my honest experience). After searching/reseraching a lot on Google, I thought maybe this was because I was consuming 2 mugs of milk everyday. Then, I questioned myself: How is this even possible? I have been having two glasses of milk since I was a child. This couldnt do bad to me. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WHAT I'M ADDING TO MY MILK COULD BE THE REASON, BUT I NEVER CONSIDERED ""MILK"" AS THE REASON. After a lot of self control, I absolutely stopped consuming milk. And mind you guys, for me, it has been the best decision I have ever taken in my life. I started drinking black coffee, and I was feeling so energetic, and so good that I cannot even express this thing in words. I started missing milk badly. I thought of considering nut milk as an alternative, but oh my god you guys! It was so expensive. Then, after watching a lot of YouTube videos, I started making my own Nut milk coffee which tastes very similar to the coffee made from milk (I can promise that). Eg: This (picture above) is the coffee I made with cashews. Then, eventually I even started making more dairy free things like cheesey dishes, ice cream and chocolate cake. I am not considering MILK as BAD, as I havent done enough research on it. I was just sharing my experience, so that if you are one of the person who's having similar issues can give this a try! I even want to share some more things with my Quora fam like: But as this answer has already been so long, I might write a PART- 2 of it. I hope you guys will read that too. I can promise you, part 2 is going to be more intresting than this answer (if I ever write that in future).

"Teenagers, what do you eat in a day?","I have seen this a lot lately and I decided I would have a go at this. Disclaimer: I am a 15-year-old boy and I am well aware that my diet is not the most healthy. Breakfast (9:30am–10:00am): I usually don’t have breakfast on weekday mornings because it takes too much time and I can’t be bothered. On the weekend I will have breakfast roughly around 9 am but sometimes later. On weekends, I will probably have one of these: BLT Bacon, Egg and BBQ sauce sandwich Chocolate chip pancakes made by yours truly. Lunch (12:40–1:20): I sometimes skip lunch on the weekends because I forget about it since I am still full from breakfast. On weekdays I have to make my own lunch for school. Our school cafeteria has lots of options but due to my allergies, (milk and strawberries) and my anaphylaxis (peanuts and tree nuts) I find it easier to pack my lunch. I pack it the night before so I can savor a few more minutes of sleep in the mornings. I usually pack two of these with this tuna: I always eat them separately because I hate when wet foods and dry foods touch or dry foods getting soggy. Snacks (9:45–10:00) : On weekends, I don’t usually don’t snack very much. Although sometimes I bake brownies or cookies which I will snack on with some tea in the afternoon. Although, at my school, we have a snack break during the day so I often will bring some snacks: Strawberries. I need to stop eating strawberries since I am intolerant but they are so tasty. Banana bread Milo cereal. Like this but without the milk (I got some of this when I went to Australia) That’s usually all for snacks. I don’t eat all of these all at once I will have one of these options a day. I might eat some chips when I get home from school since I am likely hungry. Not the full bag. Dinner: Dinner is the only meal of the day that I always eat. Sometimes I sit at the table with my family while we eat dinner and sometimes we have dinner in front of the TV. Today I am eating lasagna (dairy-free): Although often when I eat at my dad’s house we will have: nachos (dairy-free) Pizza Carbonara (with dairy-free cream) At my mum’s house, I rarely ever have dessert. If I do it will be a piece of white chocolate. Although at my Dad’s house, we make dairy-free, nut-free, strawberry free delicious icecream. sometimes I eat these: Monte Carlos. I probably shouldn’t eat them since they may contain peanuts, tree nuts, and milk. They also CONTAIN strawberry jam. Again they are really tasty so I can’t stop myself from eating them sometimes. Okay, that is all I eat in a day. As you can see I am horrible at keeping my allergies/intolerances in check. Something to work on I guess. I also drink about 4–5 bottles of water a day and I have to walk to the train every day and then get off a bit before my school and walk the rest of the way to school. I have to do this coming back from school too. I walk around a lot at school since the campus is HUGE. I also go bike riding about 3-4 times a week.

Why are avocados classified as not vegan?,"Almonds, cherries, plums, avocados, alfalfa, sunflowers, clover, squash, clementines, tangerines, cranberries, blueberries, pumpkins, apples, and a whole assortment of other vegetables could be on the non-vegan list. What do these crops have in common? They are all pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European Honeybee. Hives of bees are transported around the country in complicated rotation as the crops bloom, so they can visit the fields and pollinate the plants. Without the hardworking little bees, we would have far fewer fruits, nuts and vegetables to put on the vegan table. Vegans object to using honeybees to pollinate crops, especially almonds and avocados because those are the heaviest users of bees. It is thought that the stress of constant transportation contributes to colony collapse, an issue that has become increasingly problematic. Vegans object to the exploitation of honeybees, either by taking (they say stealing) their honey, or by transporting them around to fertilize crops. But keeping track of which crops are pollinated by migratory bees and which are not, and figuring out how crops that require honeybees to pollinate them can be grown without the industrious insects, makes the issue a little more complicated than simply avoiding almonds and avocados. Both are good sources of healthy fats, protein and other nutrients essential when you are eating a meat and dairy free diet. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/migratory-beekeeping-mind-boggling-math/ Home sick: impacts of migratory beekeeping on honey bee (Apis mellifera) pests, pathogens, and colony size",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-127566208-50-brivfufuidbtszrvopbedgmujjnxvgac.jpeg']

"What is the most disrespectful thing you ever saw or heard in a restaurant, coming from a tourist?","Not sure if disrespectful or unobservant or even just plain dumb. There's a tiny little restaurant in the Latin Quarter in Paris called Le Chat Qui Peche (the Fishing Cat). The signage clearly says it specialises in regional specialities (mainly from near the Alps). The large and unmissable lettering in the windows boasts of raclettes, tartiflettes and fondue which featured strongly in the menu displayed outside. We are talking serious cheese consumption here with almost every dish containing vast amounts of delicious melted cheese. Even the onion soup is served with toasted bread and melted cheese, as is tradition. We stumbled across this restaurant one bitterly cold November day and nothing was more appealing than hot melted cheese with crusty bread, potatoes and ham. Just as we had been served our seriously cheesy main course and loosened our belts in preparation, two young American ladies entered and were seated. The whining started almost immediately. They both wanted dairy-free food and were harassing the very confused waiter as the only items on the menu they could possibly eat were sides of French fries or green salad. They eventually stomped out in disgust saying they would complain to every restaurant guide and the US Embassy. People, if you are on a restricted diet, please have the sense to have a quick look at the type of cuisine offered by a restaurant and a longer look at the menu.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-829891569-50-warrcrizzsyccbpvoomdaskkjjshqefw.jpeg']

The vegan lifestyle is incredibly expensive and harmful. Why are people still vegan?,"You are wrong on all counts. It is not expensive to be a vegan because plant-based foods cost a lot less than meat and dairy-based foods. Of course, for vegans to save that cash, they need to be ready to shop for produce and learn how to cook it. Even if you are the kind of vegan who is willing to spend money on vegan processed foods, like dairy-free cheese (disgusting) plant-based meat substitutes (so disappointing) and imported coconut and tamarind yogurt at $3.95 a tub, it still won’t cost as much as meat and real dairy. And a vegan diet is not harmful. The only essential nutrient missing from vegan and some vegetarian diets is B12, and you can take that as a supplement. Now, I have mentioned vegans I have known whose diet is based on canned creamed corn and Skittles, but I don’t think those people count as vegans. They just like to say they are vegans. Most of the vegans I know have a clue about how to feed themselves well without animal products because they know about a variety of vegetables, legumes and nuts, and they know how to cook. People become vegans for all kinds of reasons. Most are perfectly nice people who don’t feel the need to remind you constantly that meat is death. The worst thing about vegans is trying to find a restaurant you are all ok with eating at. If you get stuck with a dear friend sitting across the table from you who spends ten minutes interrogating the waitstaff about secret chicken broth and bootleg butter, you can become homicidal kinda fast, especially if you are hungry. This is the closest veganism comes to being dangerous: the hostility of family and friends. But expensive and harmful? I’m afraid you have been misinformed, my dear.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-49730388-50-qrmxthzzqwvtfqnnmzonobibjelnqkel.jpeg']

"Can I still be a vegetarian if I eat things like chips and chocolate? I just found out that lots of stuff isn’t vegetarian. If I still eat these things, but not meat. Am I still a strict vegetarian?","Vegans, or strict vegetarians, can still eat chocolate, just not milk chocolate. It’s very easy to find dark chocolate and dairy-free dark chocolate chips so yes, you can eat chocolate and be considered a strict vegetarian but only if you are eating the right kind. Chips are usually dairy-free unless they are things like Doritos that are flavored with cheese. Eating non-cheese flavored chips is fine.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-48463250-50-vaiqrhpqyrcepxcvalnrcqpcrmkvmipl.jpeg']

What should you say to your server if you want to send your food back?,"I have a son with a dairy allergy, so unfortunately this happens much more frequently than I care for. Just yesterday - at a higher-priced small chain restaurant with 3–5 locations - my son ordered off the vegan menu something like a chicken parmesan sandwich - breaded chicken breast, vegan mozzarella, and tomato sauce. [Edited here to add that the vegan menu offered vegan chicken or grilled tofu … my son checked the ingredients with the server for regular breaded chicken since he’s not technically vegan and that chicken was safe to eat.] The server took note of the order (“vegan cheese”), and went off. The sandwiches all finally arrive (there were four of us) and his has a sprinkle of what looks like parmesan cheese on the outside of the bread. Call the waitress back, point out what looks like regular cheese on the outside (assuming that the cheese inside the sandwich is dairy free, but who knows) and ask her to check with the kitchen. She comes back with a plate of fries, apologizing appropriately about the sandwich with a comment that it’ll be a few minutes while they make a new one. Looking at the plate of fries, there is melted cheese on the fries in the corner - I assume it’s from either his very own plate (and thus dairy free cheese) or a sloppy kitchen that spilled cheese of some sort into the fry tray. My son is allergic, this is not a food preference, so I call over the manager. He takes the fries back with another hearty apology. Very soon the server comes back with a complimentary cup of chili for my son - he had made a comment about chili earlier. This was a very good gesture of good will. By this point my husband was nearly through his sandwich, my sister was 80% done with her entree salad, and I had eaten only half of my fries but was waiting on my own sandwich out of solidarity with my son who had eaten very little so far while waiting. The sandwich is finally delivered by the manager. We smile and say it looks good, thanks for checking on it. My son immediately realizes that they gave him DOUBLE breaded chicken breast inside - probably to say “sorry”. He also notices cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella… on a chicken parmesan sandwich. Who uses cheddar on a chicken parm? Oh well… he didn’t want to wait another 10 minutes for them to correct it *again* to the original order.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-57868752-50-xvktjeiuzoevwizxswzcntfqedxassuw.jpeg']

What is an open secret in your profession that we regular folk don't know or generally aren't allowed to be told about?,"Frankly, you knowing this is going to help me more than it’ll help you. As a former catering staff, here’s a “secret”: Please stop trying to help your waitresses by passing your finished plates to them, or putting it on their trays. I know a lot of people think they’re doing us a favor, making things more convenient, but you’re not. Last I checked I only have 2 hands and 10 fingers. I’m flexible, but not enough that I can carry more plates on one foot and manoeuvre the room with the remaining limb. I have an innate sense of how to balance my tray, and you taking drinks off or putting plates on when I’m not prepared for it throws the entire balance out the window. And then it’s your food on your shirt, and you’ve got no one but yourself to blame. The other secret? Most high end event functions have all sorts of dietaries pre-prepared. Even if you were somehow gluten-free (GF), dairy-free (DF), nut-free (NF), AND seafood intolerant, it’s likely the kitchen has an all-free canapé/entree/dessert as backup. So if you forgot to register as a vego in advance, you won’t starve to death - just discreetly ask the catering staff if there’s anything they have that will cater to your dietar(ies). And sometimes, the pre-prepared defrosted vegan pizza pies taste better than those freshly prepped hummus eggplant sablés.",['https://qsf.cf2.quoracdn.net/-4-images.new_grid.profile_default.png-26-688c79556f251aa0.png']

I love the peppermint and the chocolate/coconut Luna bars. Not only are they delicious, but they're also sold both in bulk, in mini-size, and individually, and they aren't expensive. Luna also has a variety of other flavor you might want to try. Nugo bars, One bar (should be dairy free), all kinds of natural fruit strips (ditto), Kind bars (most likely also dairy free), and Lara bars are also some of my favorites. P.S. whatever you do, don't try the think thin bars. They're dreadful.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-115618158-50-guagkgvlqdlgbelebrhcevadvplecsrq.jpeg']
What can an inexperienced cook make as an entree for large numbers of people?,"Hi Scott, for an inexperienced cook, a large number of people could be 10–20. If you ask most housewife’s or their husbands, to prepare a dinner for 10 to 20 guests, they would have nightmares.
The same is true if you ask many professional chefs to prepare for an event of 100 or 200 guests. It’s only scary when you have never cooked or prepared for that number before. I recall being in a team here in London, where we cooked for 6000 for a Vodafone sponsored event, we had 11 separate kitchens, 10 kitchens providing for 600 covers each, 1 kitchen providing for all/any dietary differences, vegans, gluten-free, dairy free, Kosher etc. So “entree” Aka a starter, appetiser, Hors d’oeuvre, prepared by an inexperienced cook! It needs to be simple, simple with ingredients and execution. It needs to have the plating, practised many times before the event, get some Visual inspiration from books or the Internet.
Pick a theme or Culinary direction for the meal, and Follow-through.
I'd go with smoked salmon, it's simple, can be prepared ahead of time, the plate garnish can remain a wedge of lemon, some cucumber 🥒, and buttered brown bread, and smoked salmon. 20 covers will need 2kg sliced smoked salmon, 1 large cucumber, 4 lemons cut into 6 wedges, 1 loaf brown/granary bread, 200g soft butter, some extra fine capers, and a bunch of dill. 20 x 24cm or 10” white plates. I will include a plating idea too! Be safe out there. Im surprised that other answers have spaghetti, chilli, lasagne, baked potatoes Etc, as answers for ENTREE those are all “main course dishes” and not so simple to get right. I will add a few pictures of larger numbers I’ve cooked for to give an idea of scale.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-95326279-50-lexxsdhuzslvxbbwxgrqemletcagxxrt.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-902f3f786ad97286567e7a74ff9bb47c-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-da8bba63a8bdfe75e985462d48a479ad-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9a50985da1405cda142f8466231dd10b-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24fe403da8a7e91222b21c18230ea259-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a2ded185348030607049fc13aef5cdd6-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e5cb13bf0b0738d6077e016f1c01d730-lq']"
