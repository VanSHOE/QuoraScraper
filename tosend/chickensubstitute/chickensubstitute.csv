"Would you consider shifting to plant-based meats? If not, why?","I've shifted more toward plant-based protein since the start of the pandemic. I really like Beyond Burgers, and the fake chicken substitutes that aren't wheat-based are good, too. I even liked the fake jerky that Beyond or Impossible put out. I don't think people should be compelled to eat these. However, I think more people should try them. I am also looking forward to lab-grown meats. The environmental advantage is enormous, but that's not why I eat them. I genuinely like them, they have health benefits, and foodborne illness is a much smaller problem. I really encourage people to call them ""plant-based protein"". There are numerous people who get their brains in knots when they hear ""meat"" referring to anything other than what comes from animals (apparently they've never heard of nuts and might put milk of magnesia in their coffee), and many people don't like the starchy old veggie burger style ""fake meat"".",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-82190676-50-hpbcojxbqptzegitxewnphutpyatvsll.jpeg']

Is Chicken Parmigiana considered kosher?,"When it comes to kashrut (Jewish dietary law), birds are classified as meat. This means that the separation of meat and dairy applies to chicken. So no, chicken parmigiana, when made with real cheese, is not kosher. Now, if you're really craving chicken parmigiana, the best option is to switch out the cheese with one of the newer non-dairy cheese alternatives. Right now, the best option is the Daiya brand fake cheeses which look, taste, and behave like real cheese (please note that I am in no way affiliated with this company, I just enjoy making things like kosher Reubens). Alternatively, you can use real cheese and one of the various kosher soy chicken patties that are available. Personally, I prefer subbing the cheese. Note: There are a number of kosher l’Pesach breadcrumb substitutes on the market and some fantastic GF ones. Unfortunately, there aren't any cheese or chicken substitutes available for Pesach.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-3606381-50-wgaluedxzljwhbcqvxbuprkepjculiiy.jpeg']

"If it looks like tuna, smells like tuna, and tastes like tuna, shouldn't we be praising Subway for inventing a tuna substitute that is so like tuna? Why are they being sued instead?","It’s because, honesty! Trust in advertising. Calling it “Beyond tuna” would be acceptable. People need to know. Here are a couple of examples. When my first son was about 2 or 3, I was at my sister’s house. She was on a vegetarian kick, and she made a “chicken loaf.” Well, that seemed fine, but my son broke out all over his head and face! I asked her what was in it, so she showed me the can from Loma Linda foods. Chicken substitute with some other crap in it. I gave him some baking soda in water and that fixed up the breakout, but people need to know what they are eating. Many years ago I read about a young man who had so many food allergies, he was finally down to a short list of what he could eat. I remember tuna being on the list. He could eat tuna. Eating a tuna substitute might have put him in the hospital. The last several years I didn’t eat their tuna subs anymore. It just wasn’t the same taste. People just want to know what they are eating.

Why do so many people cling to the patently false belief that imitation meat products are more expensive than actual meat products?,"“Why do so many people cling to the patently false belief that imitation meat products are more expensive than actual meat products?” Somehow, this question confuses “patently false” with “easily, demonstrably true.” I do the grocery shopping at my house and regularly buy comparable meat and imitation meat products. My kid and my lovely and talented spouse are vegetarians and I’m not. Since we try to eat the same kinds of things but can’t have exactly the same dishes, I regularly buy some kind of meat and the closest vegetarian imitation equivalent. If, say, we want to have a chicken dish, I buy both real chicken and imitation chicken. Without fail, Imitation foods are at least two to three times as expensive as the real thing, and for some of the things we prefer it’s even more so. IIRC, our preferred brand of chicken substitute costs something like six times as much as the boneless, skinless chicken breasts they emulate. Now, one can certainly construct a scenario where, say, one starts with wheat flour and nutritional yeast bought in bulk and puts in a lot of work turning that in to some kind of meat substitute and have the cost for that come out ahead of the cost of some meat if you ignore the extra effort it takes, and there are fake meats which are less expensive than some cuts of meat for which there aren’t comparable version. My wife’s veggie burgers, for example, are cheaper than filet mignon or prosciutto, but that’s almost literally comparing hamburger with filet mignon and prosciutto. Without any kind of qualification or explanation, then, the premise of this question is the patent falsehood.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-59088614-50-zbouknaossobmeiykoqhptutnxvahjvl.jpeg']

Why do people eat big slabs of meat?,"Per your picture: because they don't know how to cook meat. Steak (and beef in general) is fairly unique among meats on that you can eat beef entirely uncooked—and still have it taste delicious. If you don't believe me, I challenge you to have steak tartar done well: I'd personally go so far as to assert that beef cooked anything beyond medium rare is a heresy. Beef can have a wonderfully rich taste, texture, and all around mouth feel to it. You can have it near-raw, you can have it cooked for hours in a complex stew, threaded with complex, melded flavors. It's a dish that is filling, complex, and amazingly versatile. In almost all beef dishes, the beef is the central thing. So is lamb and mutton. Usually, they're central tastes in a dish and tend to be used as a centerpiece of flavor. In other words, other flavors work in support of that meat. Chicken—like what your picture may be—is different. Chicken is good in a fairly narrow range: if you cook it too much, it gets rubbery; if you cook it too little, it can be dangerous. Many people err on the side of caution and overcook their chicken rather than pay attention to the meat. The upside to all of that is chicken doesn't overpower the flavors of a dish. It will absorb and help the various other flavors and fragrances but doesn't have a strong enough taste to shoulder them out. It provides solidity and protein to a dish without changing much the taste. Contrary to beef and mutton, chicken supports the other flavors in the dish. Turkey is even worse: that arguably is best only within a certain temperature and a specific preparation. Overcook turkey or don't brine it? It gets dry and tasteless. And, like chicken, you can't really undercook it safely. But if done well and prepared thoroughly, turkey can be succulent and rich. But its use is rather limited: usually as a slightly more flavorful chicken substitute. So, your picture: it looks like someone breaded that chicken (?) poorly and overfried it. That probably knocked out all the subsidiary tastes in the batter and spices and just made the chicken rubbery. My guess is they did that because they didn't really know how to fry the chicken well—just enough so it's cooked, not so much that all it's wiped out all taste. No wonder you'd wonder why people would eat that. As to why people eat meat at all: well, in a lot of Western cuisines, the meat is the centerpiece of the dish. Just as people in Asia might not consider something a true meal without rice (or perhaps a rice-based starch), people in the West tend not to consider a meal a meal without a meat dish, provided they're not vegetarian.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-76561259-50-wyemmrvrisqvzwrkozyrydetaplgtbld.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7573c96b92c91344a3733a3cec6ef7dd.webp']"

What are the best vegan alternatives?,"Emily Rizzo is absolutely correct. I’d like to come at your question from a slightly different angle. Unless you have already given up all animal products, my advice is to taper. You can easily ruin an attempt to become vegan by trying to quit cold turkey. Or cold Tofurkey in this case. Get rid of red meats, make do with chicken, fish, etc. Then move to chicken substitutes like Qorn and learn to make dishes with high-quality meatless hotdogs and meatless sausage, as low as possible in sodium, or using skimpy quantities. There are lots of milks made without bovine help, and you should try them all. My favorite is Oatley. On cereal and in coffee it completely satisfies my milk craving—a formidable task for mere oats.

Can you substitute chicken thighs in a recipe that calls for chicken breasts?,"I can’t add a lot to the other answers - yes you can use thighs instead of chicken breasts, but the flavour, texture and nutritional content will change slightly, because thighs have a stronger flavour, softer texture and higher fat content. You could also try substituting other protein sources - the recipe police won’t pounce! Depending on the actual recipe, you may find that a steak of firm fish works well, for example, although you will probably need to reduce cooking time. Here in the UK you can buy vegetarian chicken substitutes, which I understand some people actually like (yuck!) In smmary, I think what I am really saying is give it a try - if you’re doubtful about it, try it out on yourself before you let it loose on anybody else - you can always bin it and have a cheese sandwich!",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-24930155-50-HVgTh1bgV6tvAAKSMB4CKTlb8bZZ78Na.jpeg']

What goes well in a creamy (mycoprotein) chicken dish?,"Ooh, pesto! I mean, personally I think pesto goes with most things, but chicken (or chicken substitute) and cream / yoghurt and pesto is one of the yummiest combinations there is. You can make your own pesto by finely chopping and mushing up pine nuts, basil, garlic, olive oil and cheese (Parmagiano is traditional, but I sometimes add pecorino, or substitute something like Grana Padano which is half the price over here) in a pestle and mortar. Don't be tempted to use a blender or it'll go too goopy. Alternatively jarred pesto works just as well for this particular recipe (yeah, yeah, I said it, don't have a heart attack folks) since heating the pesto changes the flavour a lot anyway. Anyway, fry the chicken / chicken substitute with a little oil. I like to add diced onions at this point. Then, in the same frying pan, add your cream or yoghurt and your pesto and let it simmer for a few minutes. I'm not sure how mycoprotein works (I don't cook with it) but in the case of chicken the sauce will soak up all the juices from the pan and be really yummy. I suppose you could just blend the pesto and cream / yoghurt to make a sauce without heating it, but that doesn't sound quite as tasty to me. I like to serve over tagliatelle with some cherry tomatoes and maybe a little raw spinach and pine nuts, but you could leave out the pasta if you're going low-carb, or use rice instead. And now I'm wondering if it would be good adding that sauce to sautéed mushrooms, or if the pesto and mushroom tastes would overpower each other. I might have to try that when I get home.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-27131569-50-hqxggrwzqzbvaxdifybguasyxziysczq.jpeg']
