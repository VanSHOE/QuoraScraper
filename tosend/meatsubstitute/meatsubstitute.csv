What are your thoughts on Beyond Meat's products? Do you prefer other veggie burgers/meat substitutes? Why or why not?,"I’ve eaten Impossible burgers, since I sell them at my restaurant. I think they’re okay, nothing special. I will choose a beef patty over a meat substitute patty every time, but I won’t refuse to eat one if you give it to me. Their flavor doesn’t remind me of beef, it’s something of its own. Like I said, they taste okay, but they aren’t delicious. I prefer a good grain based veggie burger over a meat substitute burger because they can have better flavor. There are plenty of lousy veggie burgers out there, but good ones aren’t hard to find. I believe the best no-meat burger option is a big fat grilled portobello mushroom cap. One of those is better than either a veggie burger or a meat substitute burger. They have great texture, are all natural and taste great. Mushrooms soak up flavor, so basting them with a tasty vinaigrette while grilling is the way to go. A grilled portobello cap is awesome on top of a beef burger as well. It’s the best choice whenever you want a mushroom burger because unlike sliced bottom mushrooms, the big portobello cap won’t fall out as you eat the burger. I’m not a big fan of processed foods and imitation meats are the pinnacle of processed foods in my opinion. Eat natural, eat a big old mushroom.",['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-155693629-50-mwuemuonlfhdjkgjhuaihvpdymekeufl.jpeg']
Are chicken of the woods poisonous?,"Chicken of the Woods is a type of wild fungus that is edible, although it needs to be cooked before eating. It is often used as a meat substitute in stews or stir fries, as it tastes like chicken. Despite this, do not eat this if its host tree is a Yew tree, as the fungus might then retain some of the tree’s toxic alkaloid properties. Never consume any kind of wild fungus unless you are absolutely sure of the type and properties of the host tree and the genus of the fungus. Very often, poisonous fungi can easily be mistaken for edible ones.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-1129610027-50-gywhxnikdwgljdqsuetkffbrsulaiugt.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-caf9f9bd10639baa50d0314bec14a340-lq']"

Is tofu supposed to taste like meat?,"No, tofu is its own thing. Nobody expects it to taste like meat. The reason some people think of it as a meat substitute is because it can be used as a major protein source for vegans and vegetarians.

How do I make tofu taste like beef?,"The first thing that popped in my head was “Why would you want to do that?” There are certain types of high-quality tofu that can be eaten on its own, without any condiments. You will find that these sorts of tofu have a very pleasant, very distinctive taste. However, if that’s too hardcore for you, there are many dishes that feature both tofu and beef. (•‿•) (I own none of the pictures below) Although I much prefer the pork version (I very rarely eat beef), you can also make mapo tofu with beef. Adjust the spice level according to your preference: You can also braise beef and tofu together for a longer period in a claypot: You can also simmer it sukiyaki-style. Simple and elegant: As you can see, many Asian cuisines don’t treat tofu as a meat substitute. We eat tofu and meat together. Tofu is tofu.
Meat is meat.
And they taste great together. I was a bit surprised when I was living in the US and saw people eating tofu as a meat substitute.

What's the weirdest way your fast food order got messed up?,"So, when I was growing up, my parents went through a vegetarian phase. Now, we were not especially wealthy, and at that time there was not a great variety of vegetarian fast food options, so while travelling, we’d usually stop by Taco Bell, and get whatever and substitute beans for the meat. This is not important, except that I developed a taste for Taco Bell’s refried beans. Specifically, a double decker taco with no meat, substitute beans. A few months back, went to get two double deckers, no meat, substitute beans. Despite that coming up on the screen exactly like that, I got two double deckers, without a speck of beans on them, meat between the shell and tortilla and all that. It was horrid.

"Can't we all eat ""fake"" meat? It tastes just the same as ""regular"" meat.","A couple of weeks ago I had an aged flank steak at a restaurant. it was delicious. I’ve yet to see any meat substitute that can mimic the texture, taste or aroma of a good piece of meat. You can get things like sausage, where most of the flavor comes from spices, that do a reasonable job if imitating meat if you aren’t used to eating actual meat. But do a side by side comparison and the difference is obvious. I know whereof I speak. I was a committed vegetarian for ten years, a vegan for three and still eat a mostly vegetarian diet. I make a mean seitan meatloaf, and my family almost can’t tell the difference between my seitan meatballs and the ones made with beef. We actually did a taste test once, just to find out. So far, the only meat substitute I’ve found that’s as good or better than the real thing is Lightlife Deli Bologna, which is delicious. It’s not pink, like the stuff I remember eating as a kid, but it tastes better, and it has less fat and no cholesterol. It’s like a whole other animal.

What is the most universally loved food across all age groups and cultures? What makes this food so good for everyone to enjoy it as well as they do?,"Chicken. Almost everyone loves and eats chicken, and almost every culture has recipes for chicken. It’s a cheap, versatile meat, and chickens are relatively easy and inexpensive to raise. Plus, it’s delicious. People who abstain from other kinds of meat for religious reasons eat chicken. Even vegetarians and vegans want and strive to make their meat substitutes taste like chicken. Pork is still the most-consumed meat in the world (populous China leads the world in pork consumption per capita, with pork comprising 70% of the meat consumed in that country) but chicken is far more popular internationally and interculturally and is steadily catching up to the “other white meat”.","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-936837039-50-bufjwuadyjdvxmhumwmmsnozkxewbexz.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85e2d0d883be103d8bc148f5d331cd65', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3507d61fee972bca874f880bf57aa4dd-pjlq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0eddedcec742640b970333bb2beeb955-lq', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3217f1d85846c1bb7f027788e472054c-lq']"
What impact has the emergence of plant-based meat alternatives like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods had on the traditional meat industry?,"As yet, very little. Plant based meat substitutes are still too expensive. I actually like a Beyond Burger and have some in the freezer, but if I go to my butcher and ask him to grind up a coarse hamburger meat out of brisket, it will be less expensive than the Beyond Burger. When the impact comes, and it will, it will be primarily in the Supermarket and in processed meat products. Anything bought by the sort of people looking for inexpensive food. I have seen industry projections predicting that 25 % of the meat market will be meat substitutes like vegetables, tempeh, quorn, seitan. 40 % will be alternative meats like lab grown meat, insects and insect protein and the last 35 % will be a high end market for more expensive real meat. If you want to see the future, check out the cheapest supermarket sausages. Most likely they will contain less than 20 % meat and that meat will most likely be this:","['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-753846643-50-gckhqlkuyoixlyiujzkqyeiybxnrkokz.jpeg', 'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8bb02f7520181e10699b9d17a7ce89f9.webp']"
How are CHOP protesters making things worse for the USA?,"Worse? Are you kidding?
They are making it better, and not only for the USA but for the whole developed world (the only exception being citizens and businesses of Seattle) Now people can see what happens when ‘progressive’ idiots are in charge of something. The whole thing looks like a part of Somalia, and the revolutionaries started begging for handouts from day one. Despite the ‘autonomy’.
In case someone had doubts that progressives can turn a prosperous place into a shithole in no time - any doubts are now gone. This CHOP-CHAZ thing should be kept for as long as possible, and Antifa, BLM and the likes should be forced to stay in for a month, just to get an idea what they are really advocating for. It will have a profound educational effect. Later, the disaster area can be transformed into an open-air museum of marxism and “progressive” ideas.
Nobody is going to return there anyway, let’s use it for something positive. It may become a popular international tourist destination and we can even make money. Not everyone can go to Venezuela to see what marxism is, CHOP-CHAZ is as close as it gets.

Is Burger King wrong for cooking Impossible Whopper on the same grill as their beef whopper?,"Their decision to do so is neither right nor wrong. They weighed their options and did what was best for them and their customers. Typically, vegans don’t eat at Burger King and BK didn’t put the Impossible Whopper on the menu to attract them. They were very clear about the fact that the Impossible Whopper was meant to give meat eaters a non meat option, nothing more. That is also the position of the makers of the Impossible Burger product. They aren’t marketing it as a vegan or vegetarian burger but rather a meat substitute for people who want to eat less meat. Burger King also knew that in order to serve it as a vegetarian burger they would have to cook it on a grill separate from their beef patties and finish the burgers on a separate line. They weren’t prepared to do those things because it would have been cost prohibitive. Keep in mind that they were rolling the dice with this product. They had no way to gauge its success, so throwing money at it would have been pointless. I think BK met their objective: to provide a burger that replicated the Whopper yet was free of meat.

Why are there so many vegan versions of meat if the whole point is to not eat meat?,"If it’s a vegan version, its not meat. Problem solved! The thing here is that meat tastes good. Yes, de gustibus and all that, but it does appear that, broadly speaking, people really like to eat meat. Vegans and vegetarians who give up meat often miss it (giving up bacon seems particularly difficult), and as global living standards have increased over the past several decades, per capita consumption of meat on a global basis has increased as well. That is, when people start to get out of poverty, one of the things they start spending money on is more meat. And there have been all manner of experiments with meat substitutes for many centuries; wheat gluten (seitan) as a meat substitute is at least 1500 years old. Why? Because people like it. It tastes good. Which brings us to vegan meat substitutes. A lot of former meat eaters have gone in that direction because they believe it’s healthier or more ethical or better for the planet. They rarely do it because they don’t like meat. So the vegan/vegetarian diet is a means to an end (that is, the point isn’t not to eat meat per se, but rather not to kill animals or eat too much fat or whatever), and they’re doing something which is good and virtuous but not necessarily enjoyable. But what if they could get the flavors and textures they like without killing all those animals? That’s a win-win situation! Fake meats are a solution to a problem posed by vegetarian diets. They let people consume a plant-based diet and get the flavors and textures they want.

"When did you think, ""You do it, but without me!""?","(The Ikea insect burger). This means, I am , personally, out. The European Commission has allowed insect powder to be mixed into our food already since two weeks, as long as we eat industrial food. There were insect burgers or similar before, but those dishes had to be labeled as such. Now, if you don't want to consume insects, you always have to read the fine print, that is, the ingredients list. For every hundred grams of meat in a product, the industry is allowed to add 5 grams of cricket powder. Especially if you buy sausage at the meat counter that is not packaged, you would now have to ask about the ingredients if you don't want to eat insects. An even stranger idea: the insect powder may be added to vegan meat substitutes as well. I don't know what a real vegan will say about this. He doesn't even eat honey, so that no bee is exploited. Who would think that such a person would prefer to eat a grasshopper? Fortunately, I eat as good as always only freshly prepared food from fresh ingredients.

"Teenagers, what do you eat in a day?","Hi, I’m a 15 year old male, I’m just about 179 cm (5′9) and I weigh 76 kg (167 pounds). I have a pretty healthy diet with a lot of protein and carbs to fuel me throughout the day. Breakfast: My breakfast consists of at least 4 slices of bread with butter. And sometimes when I’m feeling like it’s going to be good day I might add some cheese or salami. To drink, I drink two or more glasses of milk and of course I’m reading the newspaper. This is a classical Swedish open faced breakfast sandwich with egg and Kalles Kaviar. Which is fish egg mixed with tomato purée. Lunch: Here in Sweden we have this beautiful thing where every Swedish school kid gets free lunch no matter where you live and what school you go to. The lunches are often really nutritional and consist of everything you need to eat during a meal. There is always a main carb like potato, pasta, rice and bulgur. In most schools there is also a big sallad buffet and of course there is always a protein. Previously it was nearly always fish or meat but due to new laws and rules at least once a week this consists of a meat substitute. I personally don't have a problem with this since I think it’s good that we are starting to eat meat substitutes. Today's lunch consisted of chicken and potatoes this was with a yoghurt sauce. We get served the lunch in a buffet way and therefore we can have as much lunch as we want with some exceptions, if there is a limited amount of something such as meatballs. Snacks: When I get home from school I usually eat a one or two apples or two sandwiches so I have energy to study. I also eat a smaller meal before practice. This is often the leftovers from the previous day. Dinner: Just like my lunch, our dinners consist of meat often some kind of stew with potatoes since we swedes love our potatoes. We also eat a lot of different versions of minced meat such as tacos, hamburgers and meatballs. This is a classic Swedish meatball with cucumber pickled in vinegar, lingonberries and a gravy made with the fat from the meatballs.
